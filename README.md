Using C++, I wrote code that finds who has the fastest Spacecar by calculating each of their speeds and comparing them. This problem required multiple formulas to calculate the fuel rate, time, distance, and velocity of every space car to ultimately calculate the efficiency. Lastly, each Spacecar is compared with one another and the initials of the fastest Spacecar are returned. My code solves the problem found [here](https://open.kattis.com/problems/spacerace).
